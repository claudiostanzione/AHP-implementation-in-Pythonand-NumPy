# AHP-implementation-in-Pythonand-NumPy
Implement the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a Python program.

Requests:

1.The input for  the  program  is  represented  by  a  set  of  text  files  (CSV  format)  containing pairwise comparison matrices for criteria and alternatives for each criterion.

2.Additional inputis represented by AHP parameters like RCI table, threshold for consistency, etc.

3.The outputof the program is represented by all the results (final and intermediate) offered by the AHP.

4.The program must be interactivefor the end-user, thus it should ask for file namesandinput parameters,  communicate  the  consistency,  ask  to  change  pairwise  comparison  matrices, provide results on the standard output, etc.

5.The program must work with any numberof criteria and alternatives.

6.The program must be organized in Python functions.


Python tools

Use NumPy to handle all vector-based structures and operations.

Use  Spyder  (in  theAnaconda  package)  to  write  the  program.You  must  create  a  Spyder Project.
